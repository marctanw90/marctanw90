## Hi, I'm Marc 👋

I’m a claims analyst working in the reinsurance industry.  My role requires collaborating amongst the other functions to design innovative Life & Health products. I am intrigued with how data science and machine learning approaches are able to perform predictions and forecasting which may be incorporated in my line of work.

Concurrently, I'm a student at General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. Upon completion, I’m looking to transition into data science role to further my knowledge and be able to implement the skills I've learnt.
